            How to publish your design ideas on Medium
        </center>
    </h1>
    <p>Tapping into a community of designers who love to write and writers who love to design.</p>

    <p>So, you’re a designer. You make things clear. Make things beautiful. You wrestle with complex challenges for
        brands and users; you spend your days</p>

    <p>For me, the journey with writing began nearly two decades ago, back when I was just getting started in design.
        <mark>My head was full.</mark> Too full, maybe. You know how it is when you’re learning a ton of new stuff —
        exciting, but overwhelming.</p>
    <h2>What exactly is Medium and how does it work?</h2>

    <p><mark>Medium is a platform for people with good ideas to share. While the rest of the internet keeps getting
            busier and louder year after year, Medium feels like a quiet place — a place for longer-form writing and
            deeper reflection
            .</mark>
        <br> Here’s the gist:
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Anyone can write : </b> From seasoned industry leaders to those just starting out, Medium is open to all
            voices.</li>
        <br>
        <li> <b> all about discovery: </b> <mark>Medium uses a combination of human curation and algorithms to surface
                interesting stories to readers based on their interests and reading history.</mark> </li>
        <br>
        <li> <b>Publications:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>These are like specialized magazines within Medium. Many are run by individuals like myself <u>(with
                        the UX Collective),</u> while others are official blogs for major companies<u> (think Microsoft
                        Design).</u> </li>
